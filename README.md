# Invenio

### Overview

Invenio enables transforming the raw video streams into actionable intelligence. Real-time AI analytics, searchable events, and powerful investigation tools cut incident response time and improve audit readiness.

With applying state-of-the-art computer vision models to live or recorded video streams, the system automatically detects people, vehicles, faces, license plates, and unusual behaviors. Each event is indexed in real time, enabling administrators to search, filter, and retrieve relevant footage instantly.

The platform provides a secure investigator console where incidents can be reconstructed using timelines, smart filters, and case files. Evidence can be exported with full audit logs and chain-of-custody protection, ensuring legal and compliance requirements are met.

Deployable on-premises, in the cloud, or in hybrid configurations, the solution scales from a few cameras to thousands. With modular AI engines, robust APIs, and seamless integration into existing security and IT systems, it helps security teams reduce investigation time, improve situational awareness, and ensure regulatory compliance while protecting privacy.
